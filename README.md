# Optimization using Metaheuristics 

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects focused on solving various optimization problems using metaheuristic algorithms. These projects explore applications in control systems, scheduling, machine learning, and other domains where optimization is critical. Metaheuristic techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and others are employed to tackle these problems.

Each project in this repository demonstrates the practical use of optimization techniques in different scenarios, with clear explanations and well-documented code. Below is an overview of the included projects:

## 1. Optimization of Unconstrained Test Function
In this project, we aim to optimize a set of unconstrained mathematical test functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, or Rosenbrock functions) using metaheuristics. These benchmark problems are commonly used to evaluate optimization algorithms in a multidimensional space. Metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to find the global minimum.

## 2. PID Control of DC Motor
This project applies metaheuristic optimization to tune the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller of a DC motor. The goal is to achieve an optimal set of PID parameters that result in the best motor performance in terms of speed control, stability, and minimal overshoot.
